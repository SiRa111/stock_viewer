CONDITIONALS allow the program to make a desicion

if x < y
x < y is a boolean ie true or false value

if x < y :          statement 1
    print("yay")
if x > y:           statement 2
    print("welp")
if x == y:          statement 3
    print("um")

each time  the if condition is run. ie if statement 1 is true the code runs then the second statement is also checked and the third too. similarly even if it were false all the three statements would be checked. for a program conssisting if billions of lines of code. this slows down the process so we make our code more efficient :

if x > y:               s1
    print("yay")
elif x < y:             s2
    print("welp")
else :                  s3
    print("x == y ")

now if statement one is true the rest are ignored. the execution only proceeds if the statement is false.

0 OR
you can enter more than one condtion to check
if x < y or x > y:
we are checking both. if either is true, the code will run

more efficient way :
if x != y:

0 AND
