)SyntaxError : error in the written code
eg: incomplete string
-->fix : do it manually by rereading the code

)ValueError : another value type was entered than the one anticipated
eg: int(input("enter Input here: "))
input: "cat" , 78.90
both these are not int so we get ValueError
-->fix : use try except in code
